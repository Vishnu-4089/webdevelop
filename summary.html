                Electronics Engineering can be defined as the branch of engineering that utilises
                electrical components such as semiconductors, transistors, diodes and others to
                 design Electronics circuits, devices, integrated circuits and electronic systems.
                 The engineers typically also design passive electrical components, usually based
                  on printed circuit boards.  Electronics engineers also test circuits built using 
                  various electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors etc.

    <summary> elctronics communication</summary>
    <p>In ancient days, the communication can be done using Morse code
         in the telegraphs. These telegraphs use Morse code for long-distance
          communication over wires. Afterward, the wired telephone, the TV &
           the wireless radio was invented by the electronic industry. But at
            present, the information can be shared easily with each other at any 
            place and anytime using e-communication. The communication is mandatory 
            in different fields for processing, controlling, making decisions, and 
            planning. The different fields are finance, accounting, establishment, 
            personal, market, sales, purchase, production, etc. This article discusses
             what is electronic-communication, types, protocols, and 
             electronic communication applications.
